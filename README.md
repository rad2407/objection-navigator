#Objection Navigator Project

🧱 The main parts

Firebase

Think of this like a cloud notebook.

It saves your stuff (objections, categories, notes) so you don’t lose it when you close the tab.

It also lets you sign in with Google so your data is saved to your account, not just your computer.

React

This is the “engine” that makes the app interactive.

It changes the screen fast without needing to reload the page.

Objections Library

This is a big list of objections (like “It’s too expensive” or “I need to think about it”).

Each objection has answers written in steps: Acknowledge, Differentiate, Anchor, Close (ADA+C).

You can search, edit, add, delete, or import/export them.

Navigator (the practice tool)

This is like a “choose-your-own-adventure” for sales conversations.

You ask the agent a question, they pick a reply, and the Navigator shows the next step.

You can add, edit, or delete these conversation “nodes” (like branches on a tree).

Share + Cloud Save

You can save your objections in the cloud.

You can create a share link so other people can see your set.

You can import/export JSON files (that’s just computer text files with your data).

🔄 What happens when you use it

You open the app.

It checks if you’re signed in with Google.

If yes, it loads your saved stuff from the cloud.

If no, it shows a button to sign in.

You can browse objections on the left and see the details on the right.

You can quick edit small changes, or full edit to change everything.

You can practice sales conversations in the Navigator.

Everything you do gets saved automatically to your computer and the cloud (if signed in).

🧩 Think of it like this

The Objections tab = your big notebook of comebacks.

The Navigator tab = role-playing practice, like flashcards that talk back.

The Firebase + Google Sign In = your backpack that keeps your notebook safe, even if you lose your computer.
